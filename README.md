The Credit Card Default Dataset contains 30,000 instances and 23 features.
The target variable is default.payment.next.month.

## Models Used and Evaluation Metrics

| Model | Accuracy | AUC | Precision | Recall | F1 | MCC |
|------|---------|-----|----------|-------|----|----|
| Logistic Regression | | | | | | |
| Decision Tree | | | | | | |
| KNN | | | | | | |
| Naive Bayes | | | | | | |
| Random Forest | | | | | | |
| XGBoost | | | | | | |

## Observations

| Model | Observation |
|------|------------|
| Logistic Regression | Performs well for linear relationships |
| Decision Tree | Overfits without pruning |
| KNN | Sensitive to feature scaling |
| Naive Bayes | Fast but assumes feature independence |
| Random Forest | Balanced and robust |
| XGBoost | Best overall performance |
